## Image Enhancement

These are 2 applications for basic image enhancements, such as grayscale, binarization, low-pass filter, etc.
The applications are in Visual basic and Matlab.

Visual Basic:
- Grayscale
- Binarization 
- Brightness (soon)

Matlab:
- Grayscale
- Binarization
- Low-Pass Filter
- High-Pass Filter
- Median Filter
- Brightness (soon)

I'm not sure about the Filters part at Matlab, especially how I set the kernels each dimensions. But me and my group are going to fix that wrong code, if available.
